      <h2>How does MonkeyType Enhancer work?</h2>
      <p><strong>How to set up MonkeyType Enhancer: </strong>The only thing you need to do is go to settings and turn quick reset to enter. Make sure you use this after finishing a test and going to the next since MonkeyType Enhancer tracks the enter key to know when you finished a test. Also, make sure the session timer starts at zero. This can be done by reloading the page.</p>
      <p>Everything is automated by MonkeyType Enhancer to make it straighforward for the user. There are 4 phases spread out over 15 minutes of typing time:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Testing (0-5): Your accuracy from this phase determines the letter that you practice in the next phase. You can check your stats in the stats tab at the end of this phase. The language used is english 5k.</li>
        <li>Training (5-10): The letter that you missed the most during testing will be in every word in this phase for optimal practice. The language used is english 5k.</li>
        <li>Practice 1 (10-13): This phase practices a smaller set of more common words to help develop muscle memory. The language used is english 1k.</li>
        <li>Practice 2 (13-15): This phase uses a set of the 200 most commonly used words. You will eventually develop muscle memory for these words and type them faster, allowing you to practice typing at a faster speed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>After these phases, it is recommended to continue until you get a test with 100% accuracy.</p>

      <h2>Average typing speed increase</h2>
      <p>According to <a href="https://medium.com/@mantasd/touch-typing-how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-100-wpm-129ba855d038" target="_blank">medium.com</a>, once you learn touch typing, your typing speed increases at a rate of approximately 1 wpm every 2 hours and 40 minutes. How much faster is yours changing with the help of this extension? You can check in your MonkeyType profile.</p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <p><strong>What are the different languages in MonkeyType?</strong> MonkeyType has different word groups that are larger than the default for the language. The default includes 200 words which is not enough to practice for real world uses, so MonkeyType Enhancer uses larger word groups. You can change these manually by pressing escape and typing "language".</p>
      <p><strong>What is the best time length for the tests?</strong> This varies person to person, but for most people 15 seconds most directly translates to the real world since most people type in short bursts, not long periods of time.</p>
